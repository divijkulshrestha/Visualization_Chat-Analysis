# Analyzing WhatsApp chat messages across 4 years
Going through text messages between me and my friend over the last four years of college. Python was used to make the analysis and the initial visualizations, and I presented my findings using Canva. See the resulting visualizations here - https://postimg.cc/gallery/xMVK91S or look at the PNG files in the repository.
